# GreenDiwali-Awareness-Program-A-Sustainable-Approach-to-Festive-Celebrations

The provided C program aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of fireworks during Diwali and suggests alternative, eco-friendly ways to celebrate the festival. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. Menu and Options:
The program starts with a welcome message and displays a menu with three options:
Learn about the Impact of Fireworks on the Environment (Option 1).
Discover Alternative Ways to Celebrate Diwali (Option 2).
Exit the program (Option 0).

2. Functions:
Two functions, displayFireworksImpact() and suggestAlternativeCelebrations(), provide information on the environmental effects of fireworks and offer suggestions for greener celebrations, respectively.

3. Loop Structure:
Instead of a do-while loop, the program uses a for(;;) infinite loop, allowing the user to make multiple selections until they choose to exit.

4. User Interaction:
The program takes user input to determine the selected option and performs the corresponding action.

5. Exit Condition:
If the user chooses option 0, the program prints an exit message and breaks out of the loop, terminating the program.

6. Intended Impact:

(i) Education: The program educates users about the environmental consequences of traditional Diwali celebrations, particularly the impact of fireworks.
(ii) Promotion of Alternatives: By suggesting eco-friendly alternatives, the program encourages users to consider more sustainable practices during Diwali.
(iii) Behavioral Change: The information presented aims to influence individuals to adopt practices that reduce air and noise pollution, chemical residues, and waste associated with traditional Diwali celebrations.

By providing easily accessible information and alternatives, the program seeks to contribute to a more environmentally conscious and responsible way of celebrating Diwali, aligning with the theme of promoting a festival for a cause.
